## Goal

Raising awareness of existing projects within an organization.
We accomplish this by creating a content management system (CMS) that allows creating a web page for each project.
The system has to be usable such that non-technical people will have no diffulties.

## Roadmap

- [x] Create functional and non-functional requirements for minimal viable product (MVP).
- [ ] Document architecture.
- [ ] Implement back-end.
- [ ] Implement front-end.

## Functional Requirements

- [ ] As a user, I want to create a web page for my project so that other people can learn about the project.
- [ ] As a user, I want to discover other projects so that I can find projects that I might be interested in working on.
- [ ] As a user, I want to view the change history of a project page so that I can rollback or find malicious users.
- [ ] As a user, I want to specify people that can modify the project page so that I can trust the information that is being added.
- [ ] As a user, I want to modify a page as easy as I can write an email so that I don't have to waste time on technical difficulties.
- [ ] As a user, I want to view all projects without logging in so that I don't have to log in.
- [ ] As a user, I want to search by tags or topics so that I can filter.
- [ ] As an administrator, I want to customize the look and feel of the site so that we can have company branding.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] As a user, I want to use any modern browser, including mobile.
- [ ] As a compliance officer, I want to export all projects so that we can meet compliance.
